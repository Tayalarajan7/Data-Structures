Binary Tree Representation:
	A binary tree data structure is represented using two methods.
* Arrays Representation
* Linked List Representation

1. Arrays Representation
 In array representation we use one-dimentional array (1-D Array) to represent
a binary tree. To represent a binary tree 'n', we need one dimensional array 
with a maximum size of 2n+1.

2. Linked List Representation
 We use a doubly linked list to represent a binary tree. In doubly linked ,
every node consists of three fields. First field for storing left child address,
second for storing actual data and third for storing right child address.
