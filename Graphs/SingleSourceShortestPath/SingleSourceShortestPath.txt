Overview:
	Previously, we used the "breadth-first-search" algorithm to find the
"shortest path". It works on unweighted graph. But in real life, we often need
to find the "shortest path" in a weighted graph.

Edge relaxation:
Is a process of choosing the shortest path from a source to destination.

Example:
An alternative way to understand why this process is called ‘relaxation’ is to 
imagine that each path is a rubber band of length 1. The original path from A to 
D is of length 3, so the rubber band was stretched to 3 times its original 
length. When we relax the path to length 2, by visiting C first, the rubber 
band is now only stretched to twice its length, so you can imagine the rubber 
band being relaxed, hence the term edge relaxation.

1.Dijkstra's Algorithm
	Dijkstra's algorithm can only be used to solve the "single source
shortest path" problem in a weighted directed graph with non-negative weights.

“Dijkstra's Algorithm” uses a “greedy approach”. Each step selects the “minimum weight” from the currently reached 
vertices to find the “shortest path” to other vertices.


2.Bellman-Ford Algorithm
	"Bellman-Ford algorithm", on the other hand, can solve "Single-source
shortest path" in a weighted directed graph with any weights, including, of
course, negative weights.
