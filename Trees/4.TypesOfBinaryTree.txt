Types of Binary Tree:
* Full/Proper/Strict Binary Tree
	Each node must have two childrens except the leaf node.
	Each node can have 0 or 2 childrens.

Properties of Full Binary Tree:
* The number of leaf nodes is equal to the number of internal nodes plus 1.
* The maximum number of node is equal to 2pow(h+1)-1.
* The minimum number of nodes in the full binary tree is 2*h-1

* Complete Binary Tree
The complete binary tree is a tree in which all the nodes are completely filled 
except the last level. In the last level, all the nodes must be as left as 
possible. In a complete binary tree, the nodes should be added from the left.

Properties of Complete Binary Tree:
* The maximum number of nodes in complete binary tree is 2pow(h+1)-1.
* The minimum number of nodes in complete binary tree is 2h.

* Perfect Binary Tree
	A tree is a perfect binary tree if all the internal nodes have 2 
children, and all the leaf nodes are at the same level.

* Degenerate Binary Tree
	The degenerate binary tree is a tree in which all the internal nodes 
have only one children.

* Balanced Binary Tree
	The balanced binary tree is a tree in which both the left and right 
trees differ by atmost 1.

For example, AVL and Red-Black trees are balanced binary tree.
