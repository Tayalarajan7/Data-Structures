Graph:
	A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges.
The nodes are also referred as vertices and the edges are lines or arcs. A
graph can be seen as a cyclic tree, where the vertices maintain complex
relationship among them.

Application of Graph data structure:
* Graphs are used to represent networks. 
* The networks may include path in a city or telephone network or circuit
network. 
* Graphs are also used in social networks like linkedin, facebook.
Example: In facebook, each person is represented with a vertex. Each vertex
is a structure and contains information like person id, name, gender, locale etc.
