Level Order Traversal:
	Level order traversal of a tree is breadth first traversal for the tree. 

Code:
def levelOrder(root):
    q=[]
    q.append(root)
    while len(q):
        temp = q.pop(0)
        print(temp.key, end = " ")
        if temp.left:
            q.append(temp.left)
        if temp.right:
            q.append(temp.right)

Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree 
Space Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree
