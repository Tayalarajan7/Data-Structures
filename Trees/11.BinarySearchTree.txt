Binary Search Tree:
	Binary search tree can be defined as a class of binary trees, in which
the nodes are arranged in a specific order. This is also called ordered binary
tree.

	In a binary search tree, the value of all the nodes in the left sub-tree
is less than the value of the root.

	Similarly, value of all the nodes in the right sub-tree is greater than
or equal to the value of the root.

Advantages of using binary search tree:
1. Searching become very efficient in a binary search tree since, we get a hint
at each step, about which sub-tree contains the desired element.

2. The binary search tree is considered as efficient data structure in compare
to arrays and linked lists. In searching process, it removes half sub-tree at
every step. Searching for an element in a binary search tree takes O(log 2n) 
time. In worst case, the time it takes to search an element is O(n).

3. It also speed up the insertion and deletion operations as compare to that
in array and linked list.
