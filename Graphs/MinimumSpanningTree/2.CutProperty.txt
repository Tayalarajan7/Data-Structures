Cut Property:
	Cut is a partition of vertices in a "graph" into two disjoint subsets.

Crossing Edge:
	Crossing edge is an edge that connects a vertex in one set with a vertex
in the other set.	

For any cut C of the graph, if the weight of an edge E in the cut-set of C is 
strictly smaller than the weights of all other edges of the cut-set of C, then 
this edge belongs to all MSTs of the graph.
