Dequeu (Doubly Ended Queue) in python is implemented using the module collections.
Deque is preferred over a list in the case where we need quicker append and
pop operations from both the ends of the container, as deque provides an
o(1) time complexity for append and pop operations as compared to list which
provides o(n) time complexity.

Example:
from collections import deque

queue = deque(['name','age','DOB'])
print(queue)

Output:
deque(['name', 'age', 'DOB'])
