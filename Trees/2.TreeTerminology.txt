Tree Terminology:
1.Root
	The node at the top of the tree is called root node. 

	Every tree must have a root node.

	There is only one root per tree and one path from the root node to any 
node.

2.Parent
	The node which is predecessor of any node is called as Parent Node.

	The node which has child/children.

3.Child
	The node which is descendant of any node is called as Child Node.

	In a tree, any parent node can have any number of child nodes.

	In a tree, all nodes except root are child nodes. 

4.Siblings
	Nodes which belongs to same parent are called as Siblings.
Example:
If A is the parent of element B and C. Then B and C are siblings.

5.Leaf
	The node which does not have any child node is called the leaf node.

	Leaf nodes are also called as External or Terminal nodes.

6.Degree 
	The total number of children of a node is called as Degree of that node.

Example:
If element A has two child nodes then its degree is 2.

7.Level
	Level of a node represents the generation of a node. If the root node is
at level 0, then its next child node is at level 1, its grandchild is at level 2,
and so on. 

8.Height
	The total number of edges from leaf node to a particular node in the
longest path is called as Height of that Node.	

9.Depth
	The total number of edges from root node to a particular node is called
as Depth of the node.

* Depth of a tree-
	The total number of edges from root node to a leaf node in the longest
path is said to be Depth of the tree.

Depth of root node is zero.

10.Path
	The sequence of Nodes and Edges from one node to another node is called
as path between that two nodes.

11.Subtree
	Each child from a node forms a subtree recursively. Every child node
will form a subtree on its parent tree.

12.Visiting
	Visiting refers to checking the value of a node when control is on the
node.
