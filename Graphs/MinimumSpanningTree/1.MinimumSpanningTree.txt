Spanning Tree:
	A spanning tree is a connected subgraph in an undirected graph where all
vertices are connected with the minimum number of edges.

	A undirected graph can have multiple spanning trees.

Minimum Spanning Tree:
	A minimum spanning tree is a spanning tree with the minimum possible
total edge weight in a "weighted undirected graph".
