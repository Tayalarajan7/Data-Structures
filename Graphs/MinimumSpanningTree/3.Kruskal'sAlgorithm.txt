Kruskal's Algorithm:
	Kruskal's algorithm is an algorithm to construct a "minimum spanning
tree" of a "weighted undirected graph".

Algorithm:
* Ascending sort all edges by their weight
* Add eges in that order into the minimum spanning tree. Skip the edges that
would produce cycle in minimum spanning tree.
* Reapeat step 2 until N-1 edges are added.
