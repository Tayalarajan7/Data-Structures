Depth First Search (DFS):
	In Graph theory, the depth first search is main used to:
1. Traverse all vertices in a graph
2. Traverse all paths between any two vertices in a "graph"

Complexity Analysis:
* Time Complexity: O(V+E). Here, V represents the number of vertices, and E
represents the number of edges. We need to check every vertex and traverse
through every edge in the graph.

* Space Complexity: O(V). Either the manually created stack or the recursive 
call stack can store up to V vertices.
