Union By Rank:
	Rank refers to height of each vertex. We will merge the shorter tree
under the taller tree and assign the root node of the taller tree as the root
node for both vertices. In this way, we effectively avoid the possibility
of connecting all vertices into a straight line. This optimization is called
the "disjoint set" with union by rank.
