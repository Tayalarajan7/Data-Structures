Binary Tree:
	A tree whose node can have maximum two children is called binary tree.

	Each node can have either 0,1 or 2 children.

Properties of Binary Tree:
* At each level of i, the maximum number of nodes is 2pow(i).
Example: In level 0 we can have only root node which is 2pow(0) nothing but 1
element.
	In level 1 root can have left node and right node which is 2pow(1) 
nothing but 2 element.
* The order of binary tree is 2.
* Bianry tree does not allow duplicate values
* While constructing a binary, if an element is less than the value of its 
parent node, it is placed on the left side of it otherwise right side.
* The minimum number of node is equal to h+1.
* The maximum number of node is equal to 2pow(h+1)-1. 

Advantages of Binary Tree:
1. Searching in binary tree becomes faster.
2. Binary tree provides six traversals.
3. Two of six traversals give sorted order of elements.
4. Maximum and minimum elements can be directly picked.
5. It is used for graph traversal and to convert an expression to postfix and
prefix forms.
