Trie:
	Trie is also called as digital tree or a prefix tree is a kind of search
ordered tree data structure mostly used for the efficient dynamic add/search
operations with the strings.

Advantage:
	Trie is widely used in real life: autocomplete search, spell checker,
T9 predictive text, IP routing (longest prefix matching), some GCC containers.

There are two main types of trie interview questions:
* Standard Trie
	Design a structure to dynamically add and search strings, for example
1.Add and Search Word
2.Word Search II
3.Design Search Autocomplete System

* Bitwise Trie
	Design a structure to dynamically add binary strings and compute
maximum/minimum XOR/AND/etc, for example
1.Maximum XOR of Two Number in an Array
