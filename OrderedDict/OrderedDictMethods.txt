popitem():
This method is used to delete a key from the beginning.

Syntax:
popitem(last = True)                      

If the last is False then this method would delete a key from the beginning of 
the dictionary. This serves as FIFO(First In First Out) in the queue otherwise 
it method would delete the key from the end of the dictionary.
Time Complexity : O(1).

move_to_end():
This method is used to move an existing key of the dictionary either to end or 
to the beginning. There are two versions of this function

Syntax:
move_to_end(key, last = True)

If last is True then this method would move an existing key of the dictionary in 
the end otherwise it would move an existing key of dictionary in the beginning. 
If the key is moved at the beginning then it serves as FIFO ( First In First Out )
 in queue.
